# LoginFormProject
This project features a sleek login page designed with HTML and CSS. It includes email/password fields, a "Forgot Password?" link, and a responsive layout. Explore the login.html and forgotpassword.html files to see the functionality. This is my first GitHub project, and feedback is welcome!
